This is how I added my project into the repository into my own branch:

Using git bash I changed directory into project file (cd AndroidStudioProject/MyFirstLab)

1. git init (initializes a local repository)
2. git remote add origin https://github.com/adamhh/450Group8.git
3. git checkout -b adamsBranch (create and checkout your branch)
4. git add .    (stage the files)
5. git commit -m "Some description"
6. git push origin adamsBranch
